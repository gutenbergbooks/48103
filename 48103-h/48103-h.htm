<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>It is but natural that man should desire to
leave some record of his achievements for the
information of succeeding generations. This desire
was manifested in the infancy of the race,
and is shown in monuments and chiseled stone,
and in writings on skins and reeds.</p>

<p>Here in the South, when the great war of the
’60s had terminated and the various actors in the
great drama had time to look about them, the
desire was universal that the record made by
Southern manhood should be perpetuated. The
regiment of Texas cavalry known as the “Terry
Rangers” shared that feeling; and when the survivors
began to meet in annual reunion this desire
became manifest. Two propositions appealed
to them: one for a history which should tell of
their campaigns, their marches, battles, hardships,
sufferings; one for a monument which should contain
the name of every man who served in the
regiment. For reasons which I need not discuss
here the plan for the history failed. All funds
raised for either purpose were combined into one
and placed in control of the monument committee.
The equestrian statue which now stands in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
grounds of the State Capitol in Austin is the
result.</p>

<p>The desire for a narrative still survived, however,
discoverable in many personal sketches of
events, some taking the form of memoirs, written
by various members of the command. I have
long contemplated such a work but have felt the
lack of ability. It is now perhaps too late to
attempt anything like a complete history of the
regiment, as the necessary data can hardly be
procured. Yet, when my former comrade, D. S.
Combs, appealed to me to write something that
would supply his children and grandchildren with
some knowledge, however imperfect, of the part
borne by the Rangers in the great war, I unhesitatingly
promised to try it and do the best I
could. I wish with all my heart I could make
my story as complete as it ought to be, for I
firmly believe that a well written narrative of
the regiment’s wonderful career would be the
most entertaining book in the literature of war.</p>

<p>As a first step toward the accomplishment of
the task I had undertaken, I wrote to Comrade
Combs asking him for such data as he might
have or such as his personal recollections might
supply; also as to the scope and form of the work
as he wished it to appear. His answer is so kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and trusting that I here insert it and, as the lawyers
say, make it a part of the record. His letter,
written from his home in San Antonio, is dated
January 5th:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

“My Dear Lee:<br />
</p>

<p>“Yours of the 26th of December came duly to
hand, and I should have replied sooner but I have
been strictly on the go for the last ten days, and
I have neglected many things that should have
had attention.</p>

<p>“Now, Lee, I wish to state with all the sincerity
of my heart, that all I want is plain statements
of facts; and while I give you a brief outline
of my movements, from the day I was sworn
into the service of the Confederate States to the
close of the war, I simply do this that you may
know where D.S. Combs was, and it is a matter
of indifference to me whether my name is mentioned
a single time in your story of the doings
of the regiment, and, more especially, of the part
old Company D played in that drama.</p>

<p>“I was very fearful that the war would be over
before I saw a live Yankee. So Charley McGehee
and I went fifty miles from home to join a company,
and joined Ferrell’s company between Bastrop
and La Grange. According to my recollection
this was in the latter part of August, ’61.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
“From that day to the day I left the regiment,
I was not away from Company D more than ten
or twelve days, and then on account of sickness;
once at Shelbyville for five or six days; at another
time near Nolensville for about the same
length of time.</p>

<p>“My initiation was at Woodsonville, and the
last of the chapter was at Mossy Creek, Dandridge,
and the brick house where N. J. Allen was
killed and the artillery duel where Captain Littlefield
was wounded. This, I think, was early in
January, ’64. Here I drew a furlough, and in
company with Ike Jones, Bill Fisher and Jeff
Burleson, I struck out for home. On my arrival
at home my parents and sisters insisted that I
ask for assignment to duty on this side of the
Mississippi. I had lost one brother by sickness
at Searcy, Arkansas, one had been killed at the
battle of Chickamauga, one badly wounded at Port
Hudson, and another desperately wounded at
Mansfield, Louisiana.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, I applied to General E. Kirby
Smith for such assignment, and he gave me orders
to report to General Magruder at Galveston for
assignment to duty in any cavalry command I
might select. I chose Colonel J. S. Ford’s command
on the Rio Grande. I was attached to Cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>tain
Carrington’s company in Major Cater’s battalion,
and was with that command in the last
fight of the war. This was between Brownsville
and the mouth of the Rio Grande, and was
about two weeks after General Smith had surrendered
the Trans-Mississippi department, but
the word had not reached us. I am glad to say
that in this last fight of the war the Confederate
arms were victorious. A few days after this we
got word that the war was over. So we folded
our tents and quietly and sadly turned our faces
homeward. As a company or battalion we never
surrendered. We simply laid down our arms and
tried to forget the past and all its disappointments.</p>

<p>“Now to go back and come over the story as
it actually occurred, I will simply say that I was
never wounded during the war, but particularly
unfortunate with my mounts. I had three noble
animals killed under me, two at Murfreesboro,
one at College Hill, opposite Knoxville, also one
wounded at Mt. Washington, near Louisville, Kentucky.</p>

<p>“I was with you at Farmington and at Nolensville,
where Ferg Kyle led his line of dismounted
men, deployed as skirmishers, up against a solid
line of blue, a regiment of infantry, who poured a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
galling fire into our ranks and caused us to reel
and stagger like a drunken man.</p>

<p>“I was with you at Woodsonville, Shiloh, Murfreesboro,
Bardstown, Perryville and Chickamauga.
Also at Murfreesboro when Forrest with his little
band swooped down on the two camps and took
them in out of the damp.</p>

<p>“Again, Lee, I will say that I wish you to
handle the story in your own way, and I will be
perfectly satisfied. What we want is the doings
of the <i>company</i> and <i>regiment</i>. I care not for
individual mention. If you and I are satisfied
I care not whether others are or not.</p>

<p>“I wish to emphasize this statement. I appreciate
more than you know your willingness to
undertake this for me, and will gladly remunerate
you as far as it is in my power to do for the
time you put in on the work.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Combs and I wish to thank you and your
daughter for the kind hospitality to us during the
reunion, and hope you may both find it convenient
to visit us in the near future. Wishing you
both a pleasant and prosperous New Year, I am,</p>

<p class="sig"> “Always yours, </p>
<p class="sig" style="margin-left: 30%"> “<span class="smcap">D. S. Combs</span>.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I had regretted my promise or had wavered
in the slightest from my intention, this letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
would have renewed in me the purpose to do my
best. Yet I do not see why anyone who writes
as well as Comrade Combs should desire another
to write for him. I would not, with intention,
do injustice to anyone; I know I can not do justice
to many deserving the highest praise; but I
must say that the regiment had no better soldier
than D. S. Combs.</p>

<p>Since this work was well under way Comrade
A. B. Briscoe of Company K has kindly placed at
my service a large lot of MS. of his personal memoirs.
I have used this in several instances, of
which due credit is given in the proper places.</p>

<p>Austin, May, 1911.</p>

<h3>ASSEMBLY AND ORGANIZATION OF THE REGIMENT.</h3>

<p>When in 1861 it became evident that war between
the sections was inevitable and imminent,
B. F. Terry, a sugar planter of Fort Bend county,
and Thomas S. Lubbock, of Houston, determined
to be in the fight from the start, hurried to Virginia,
at their own expense, where they participated
in the first battle of Manassas, rendering
distinguished services as scouts before the action
and in pursuit of the routed enemy afterward.
Later the War Department gave them authority
to recruit a regiment of Texans for mounted service
in Virginia. Returning to Texas they at once
issued a call for volunteers.</p>

<p>The conditions were exacting. Each man must
furnish his own arms and equipment&mdash;a gun of
some sort, Colt’s repeating pistol, a saddle, bridle
and blanket. Notwithstanding these requirements,
the response was so prompt that in less
than thirty days the ten companies were on their
way to the rendezvous at Houston. Some of the
companies had the full complement of one hundred
men, rank and file, and in a few more days
all would have been full. Probably two or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
regiments could have been raised at that time if
the call had been made.</p>

<p>The personnel was of the very highest. Sons
of leading families, many of them college graduates,
professional men, merchants, stockmen, and
farmers, served in the ranks as privates, all young,
in their teens and early twenties. Rank was
scarcely considered. The supreme desire was to
get into the war in a crack cavalry regiment.</p>

<p>Since I write without data and from memory
only, I must necessarily deal more particularly
with the company of which I was a member,
known as Company D in the regimental organization.
It was recruited largely from Bastrop, with
contingents from Hays, Travis and Burleson
counties. This organization, full at the beginning,
always one of the largest for duty, sustained
the greatest loss in killed of all the companies of
the regiment. The first officers elected were:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Captain, Stephen C. Ferrell.</li>
 <li>First Lieutenant, Charles L. Morgan.</li>
 <li>Second Lieutenant, Jesse W. Burdett.</li>
 <li>Second Lieutenant, William R. Doak.</li>
</ul>

<p>The assembly for the company was to be in the
town of Bastrop, and notice was given that on a
certain morning the march would begin. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
men from the adjoining counties reached Bastrop
the night before.</p>

<p>It was a bright, sunny August morning. The
people, <i>en masse</i>, turned out to bid us good-by.
Men, women, children, with tears in their eyes,
said, “God bless you!” when they clasped our
hands as we stood in line. This painful ordeal
over, we mounted and rode away on what we believed
was a few months’ adventure.</p>

<p>Alleyton, sixty miles away, then the terminus of
the railroad, was reached without any very exciting
adventures. We sent our horses back home
and took the train for Houston. The trains were
then run to Harrisburg, but we were dumped off
in the prairie at Pierce Junction to await a train
from Columbia. The hours passed, and the night.
We slept little on account of the mosquitoes, which
were more numerous and voracious than any I
ever met elsewhere. Next morning, as there was
still no train, we walked into Houston, a distance
of nine miles, pushing by hand the freight car
with our saddles and baggage. Here we went
into camp in an old warehouse and met some of
the other companies.</p>

<p>From McLennan and adjoining counties Captain
Thos. Harrison led a company which became
Company A. Captain John A. Wharton had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
full company raised chiefly in Brazoria and Matagorda
counties. It became Company B in the
organization and continued the largest in enlistment.
Companies C, commanded by Mark Evans;
E, by L. N. Rayburn; and I, led by J. G. Jones,
were recruited in Gonzales and surrounding counties.
Many of these were stockmen and expert
horsemen. Company F was from Fayette and
commanded by Louis M. Strobel. Company G
was from Bexar and Goliad counties. Its first
captain was W. Y. Houston. Company H was
from Fort Bend county chiefly, and commanded
by John T. Holt. Company K, Captain John G.
Walker, was from Harris and Montgomery counties,
and was full. The word “chiefly” ought to
be used in telling where the companies were recruited,
for all of them had men from several
counties. Here, too, on the 9th of September we
were “mustered in,” swearing to serve “so long as
this war shall last.”</p>

<p>From Houston to Beaumont, over a newly constructed
railroad, it took nearly all day to make
eighty miles. From Beaumont, by steamboat,
down the Neches and up the Sabine to Niblett’s
Bluff; thence a hundred miles on foot, through
water much of the way; thence forty miles in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
carts. It is easy to remember this cart ride. The
wheels were six or seven feet high. Motive power,
oxen, two pairs to each cart. Engineers, little
bow-legged Creoles, each armed with a long, sharp-pointed
pole. The vehicles had no springs. As
there were no seats, the six or eight passengers
in each conveyance had to stand on their feet. At
New Iberia, on Bayou Teche, we were transferred
to boats, and went down between the beautiful
banks of that stream to Brashear, now Morgan
City. From there we went through an almost
continuous sugar farm to New Orleans. The trip
from Houston to New Orleans took over a week.
It is now made in less than twelve hours, in a
palace car.</p>

<p>In New Orleans we learned that our destination
was not Virginia, but Bowling Green, Kentucky,
where General A. Sidney Johnston was trying to
assemble an army for the defense of that frontier.
This was pleasing to us, as General Johnston was
a Texan, and personally known to many of us.</p>

<p>The box cars in which we left New Orleans had
been used for shipping cattle, and were not overly
clean. Our seats were rough planks without
backs. In this luxurious fashion we rode for
twenty hours until we reached Nashville. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
we encamped in the fair grounds. Ladies in great
numbers visited us, and for their entertainment
our most expert horsemen gave the first really-truly
“wild-west” entertainment ever seen east of
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>At Nashville our first death occurred, Thomas
Hart, whose loss saddened us greatly. He was a
promising young man, not personally well known
to me.</p>

<p>We had expected to receive our horses here
and go on horseback to Bowling Green, but one
night Colonel Terry received orders to bring on
his regiment “at once.” At 1 o’clock in the morning
we marched to the station and waited till 2
p. m. for our train. That same afternoon we
reached Bowling Green. Our horses were driven
through from Nashville by a detail sent back after
them. We now received tents, camp utensils and
wagons. Here, too, the companies were formally
organized into a regiment by the election of the
following field officers:</p>

<ul><li>Colonel, B. F. Terry.</li>
 <li>Lieutenant Colonel, Thomas S. Lubbock.</li>
 <li>Major, Thomas Harrison.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following staff officers were appointed:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Adjutant, M. H. Royston.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></li>
 <li>Quartermaster, B. H. Botts.</li>
 <li>Commissary, Robert D. Simmons.</li>
 <li>Chaplain, R. F. Bunting.</li>
 <li>Surgeon, Dr. John M. Weston.</li>
 <li>Assistant Surgeon, Dr. Robert E. Hill.</li>
 <li>Sergeant Major, W. B. Sayers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Terry was a native of Kentucky, about 40 years
old, of great force of character, firm and self-reliant.
His appearance was commanding, and
in all ways he was fitted for high rank.</p>

<p>Lubbock was some years older than Terry. He
was a native of South Carolina. He was small
of stature, pleasant and affable, and made a favorable
impression on us. At that time he was in
poor health, soon had to go to Nashville for treatment,
and we never saw him more.</p>

<p>Harrison was a native of Mississippi. He was
a lawyer by profession. A small, nervous, irascible
man, who proved to be a fine soldier, became
a brigadier general of cavalry, and distinguished
himself on many fields.</p>

<p>Winter was now at hand, and the climate was
trying on young men raised, as we had been, in
the far South. Many fell ill of measles, mumps,
pneumonia, and other diseases peculiar to raw
levees. Scores went to the hospital, and not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
few under the sod. Still the spirits of all, from
the youngest private to the resolute colonel, were
of the highest, and all were anxious to meet the
foe. Such as were able drilled daily, mounted
guard, and performed other duties incident to
camp life in time of war.</p>

<h3>WOODSONVILLE.</h3>


<p>Terry, anxious to be doing something, was ordered
to lead the regiment to the front on picket
and scouting duty. On the 17th of December,
Brigadier General Hindman led an expedition to
Greene river. When he reached that stream he
found the north bank in possession of the enemy’s
outposts. He deployed some infantry skirmishers,
who engaged the enemy at long range but
with little effect. Called himself from the immediate
front, he left Colonel Terry in charge with
instructions to decoy the enemy up the hill and
away from support to a point where our infantry
and artillery could be used to better advantage.</p>

<p>The enemy allowed themselves to be decoyed,
and came across in large numbers. Terry, however,
was not the man to invite visitors and then
leave someone else to entertain them. Sending
Ferrell with about seventy-five men against their
left, he led the rest against their right. We
charged, yelling, each man riding as fast as his
horse could go. Terry fell, dying almost instantly.</p>

<p>Ferrell led his force into an open field against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
a body of the enemy, who rallied behind a straw
stack and such fences as they could find, pouring
a galling fire into us. On our part it was a furious
but disorderly charge of comparatively undrilled
men into one of the best drilled regiments
of the Federal army. This was the Thirty-second
Indiana Infantry. The officers and men were
Germans, who had probably learned their tactics
in the old country. They were ignorant of the
English language. They were brave fellows, and
stood like veterans till shot down.</p>

<p>In view of the great disparity of the forces engaged
and the losses sustained, this was one of
the most remarkable of all the conflicts of this
very remarkable war. One of the very few actions
where mounted men engaged infantry on
their own ground. It also shows of what stuff
the Southern volunteer was made. In support of
these statements I invite attention to the official
reports. The first is by Colonel Willich. Omitting
some unimportant details, it is as follows:</p>

<p>“But now ensued the most earnest and bloody
part of the struggle. With lightning speed, under
infernal yelling, great numbers of Texas Rangers
rushed upon our whole force. They advanced to
fifteen or twenty yards of our lines, some of them
even between them, and opened fire with rifles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
revolvers. Our skirmishers took the thing very
coolly, and permitted them to approach very close,
when they opened a destructive fire on them.
They were repulsed with severe loss, but only after
Lieutenant Sachs, who left his covered position
with one platoon, was surrounded by about fifty
Rangers, several of them demanding of him three
times to give up his sword, and let his men lay
down their arms. He firmly refused, and defended
himself till he fell, with three of his men,
before the attack was repulsed.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Colonel Von Trebra now led on
another advance of the center and left flank, when
he drew down upon his forces a second attack of
the Rangers in large numbers, charging into the
very ranks, some dashing through to the rear,
which might have proved disastrous.</p>

<p>“In the fight participated three field officers,
one staff and sixteen officers of the line, twenty-three
sergeants and 375 men. Our loss is one
officer and ten men dead, twenty-two wounded
and five missing. According to reports of our
surgeons several of the wounded are beyond hope
of recovery.”</p>

<p>I have omitted from the foregoing interesting
and more or less instructive details of the parts
played by Lieutenant Colonel Von Trebra, Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Snachenberg, Captain Wilchbilling, Adjutant
Schmidt, Lieutenant Mank and other heroes
whose names are hard to spell and harder to pronounce.
Valiant men all, and all doubtless recommended
for promotion. As will be seen hereafter,
to fight with the Rangers was to be in line
of advancement in this world or the next.</p>

<p>I now give General Hindman’s report from the
Confederate side:</p>

<p>“The firing ceased for about half an hour, and
I went in person to select a suitable place for
camp, leaving Colonel Terry in command, with
instructions to decoy the enemy up the hill, where
I could use my infantry and artillery with effect,
and be out of the range of the enemy’s batteries.</p>

<p>“Before returning to the column the fire from
the skirmishers recommenced. The enemy appeared
in force on my right and center. Colonel
Terry, at the head of seventy-five Rangers, charged
about 300 of the enemy, routed and drove them
back, but fell mortally wounded. A body of the
enemy about the same size attacked the Rangers
under Captain Ferrell on the right of the turnpike,
and were repulsed with heavy loss.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Attack was really made by Ferrell on the enemy,
advancing under command of Von Trebra, as Colonel
Willich reports.&mdash;G.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
“My loss in this affair was as follows: Killed,
Colonel Terry and three men of his regiment;
dangerously wounded, Lieutenant Morris and
three men of the Texas Rangers; slightly wounded,
Captain Walker and three men of the Texas
Rangers and two men of the First Arkansas battalion.”</p>

<p>From General Hindman’s report it will be seen
that the Rangers had 150 men in the fight, seventy-five
with Terry, seventy-five with Ferrell;
there being, in fact, two charges. Our loss was
twelve altogether. Colonel Willich reported that
he had, officers and men, 418 engaged. He had
eleven killed, twenty-two wounded and reported
five missing, a total of thirty-eight; his missing
being prisoners in our hands. Thus 150 men
charged 418, inflicting a loss of thirty-eight, sustaining
a loss of twelve. Of this number Company
D lost five: W. W. Beal and Frank Loftin
killed, L. L. Giles mortally wounded, L. B. Giles
and John R. Henry slightly wounded.</p>

<p>If a complete record could be obtained I believe
a similar disparity of losses would appear in
nearly all the engagements in which we bore a
part. The splendid horsemanship of our men,
and their skill with firearms, made them easily
superior to any foe they went against. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
fight our loss was irreparable in the death of our
gallant leader. Had he lived he would, without
doubt, have reached the highest rank and would
have achieved a fame second to none. We had
other brave leaders, but none like the matchless
Terry.</p>

<p>In the election of officers which followed the
death of Terry, Lieutenant Colonel Lubbock
was advanced to the command of the regiment,
and Captain John G. Walker became lieutenant
colonel. Lubbock, who was at that time in bad
health, died a few days later. Captain John A.
Wharton was chosen to fill his place.</p>

<p>Wharton was a man of ability, of a distinguished
family, liberally educated, a lawyer and
a captivating public speaker. Enterprising and
ambitious, he never forgot during a wakeful moment
that the soldier who survived the war would
be a voter. He distinguished himself on many
fields and became, successively, brigadier general
and major general.</p>

<p>About this time Lieutenant Morgan of Company
D resigned and Fergus Kyle was elected
first lieutenant. Kyle was subsequently promoted
to captain, and made a very efficient officer, distinguishing
himself on many fields.</p>

<p>The regiment now resumed its duty of guarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the front. The weather was cold, varied with
rain, sleet and snow. The men suffered greatly.
Some suffering, as to the weather, I escaped, having
received a slight wound. I was sent to the
hospital at Nashville, Tennessee, where I stayed
two days, going from there to the home of a relative,
where I spent nearly seven weeks. In the
care of my kindred I had all the comforts and
some of the luxuries of life. I reported for duty
just before the retreat from Bowling Green.</p>

<p>The burial squad informed me that my poor
horse, who received some of the lead intended for
his master, and yet had no personal interest in
the row, had five bullet wounds. He fell under
me near the straw stacks. I rode off the field
behind John B. Rector, who halted in a shower of
bullets and kindly assisted me to mount.</p>

<h3>RETREAT.</h3>


<p>The word is not reassuring to seasoned soldiers.
To new troops it is very depressing. Johnston’s
line was broken on the right at Fishing Creek,
and was threatened on the left at Donelson. Bowling
Green was, therefore, untenable, and now we
must fall back behind the Cumberland.</p>

<p>The Rangers must cover the retreat. It was
snowing the morning we left, and the enemy
were throwing shells into the place. Our march
to Nashville was without incident. We crossed
the Cumberland in the night and camped just
outside the city. We now learned that Donelson
had fallen, and the retreat must be continued.
We were ordered down toward Donelson to guard
in that direction, and to afford succor to such as
had escaped the surrender and might be making
their way south.</p>

<p>Returning, we found the army at Murfreesboro,
but it moved on by Shelbyville, Huntsville and
Decatur to Corinth, Mississippi, the Rangers
guarding the rear. The weather was bad and the
progress slow, but the enemy did not press us.
We crossed the Tennessee river on the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
bridge, which had been floored for the purpose.
When we went into camp rations of bacon and
flour were issued to us. Our wagons and camp
equipment being somewhere else, we were confronted
with the problem of preparing this flour
for the immediate consumption of the chronically
hungry soldier. If necessity is the mother of invention,
hunger is a most capable handmaid of
the good dame. An oilcloth is spread on the
ground, and on this the flour is kneaded, but how
to bake it was the question. Some rolled the
dough around a stake or ramrod, which they stuck
in the ground by the fire, but the stuff would slip
down. Some of us tried a flat rail, and that
answered very well. First heating the rail thoroughly,
we stuck our biscuits on it, set them before
the fire, and watched them brown, our appetites
growing keener all the while. The treatment
of the bacon was easy. We broiled it on a stick
held before the fire or above the coals, and that
is the best way it was ever cooked.</p>

<p>At Corinth we had a few days’ rest. Absentees
came in, and the <i>morale</i> improved.</p>

<p>Buell did not follow our line of march, but
moved by the more direct route through Franklin,
Columbus and Pulaski, intending to unite with
Grant at Pittsburg Landing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>SHILOH.</h3>


<p>Johnston planned to attack Grant before the
arrival of Buell, and had brought together the
largest army ever before assembled in the Confederacy.
He had the force under General Hardee
from Bowling Green, the remnant of Zollicoffer’s
army, Bragg from Pensacola with a fine corps of
well drilled and well equipped troops, and Polk
from Columbus with a light force, altogether
nearly 40,000 men. They were to attack an army
of veterans flushed with the victory at Donelson.</p>

<p>Johnston ordered the army to move on the
morning of April 3, but some of the troops did
not get away until that afternoon. It was said
that this delay was due to the inexperience of
both staff and men. Johnston had intended to
attack on the 5th, but the army, delayed by the
bad roads, did not arrive in time. Thus we lost
twenty-four fateful hours&mdash;twenty-four hours of
as precious time as was ever lost in war.</p>

<p>Our regiment reached the front on the 4th and
was ordered to guard the left wing of the army.
In detachments we guarded every road, trail and
opening around the whole left front and flank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
with strict orders that none of us be allowed to
sleep at all. Soon after nightfall it began to rain.
It poured down in torrents, and the night was
pitch dark. Whether in the saddle, on post or in
camp, we could hardly have slept in that downpour.
It was a long, dreary night, but morning,
a bright spring morning, came at last.</p>

<p>The regiment assembled once more, very wet
and uncomfortable. Our arms, too, were wet and,
fearing they would fail us in action, we implored
Colonel Wharton to let us fire them off. With
no thought of possible consequences he consented.
Pointing to a wooded hillside, he said:</p>

<p>“Go off there and shoot.”</p>

<p>We discharged all the firearms we had. It
sounded like a brisk skirmish. The colonel was
immediately summoned to headquarters. Camp
rumor said that his interview with his superiors
was rather stormy, that he was severely reprimanded.
It is a fact that on his return he made
us a speech, telling us that by yielding to our importunities
he had committed a serious blunder
which had subjected him to unfavorable criticism
by persons in the higher military circles. He
seemed to be much perturbed mentally. He asked
us to wipe out the stain by our gallant behavior
in the coming engagement; asked us to ride fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>ther
into the enemy’s ranks than any other regiment.
I think most of us audibly promised to do
what he asked; and we kept the promise as far
as circumstances would permit, as will be seen.</p>

<p>The whole army had arrived by Saturday afternoon.
Early Sunday morning, April 6th, the forward
movement began. The enemy were either
in bed or preparing breakfast, and were taken by
surprise. I know the surprise has been denied
by so eminent a person as General Grant, but as
he was sleeping at Savannah, nine miles away,
he is hardly a competent witness. Thousands of
us saw camp kettles and coffeepots on the fires,
beds just as the occupants had left them, blankets
spread and clothing strewn about.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to describe the battle of
Shiloh. I wish merely to speak of some principal
incidents. It was a continuous advance of the
Confederates nearly all of the day, Sunday. The
roar of big guns and the rattle of musketry was
unceasing.</p>

<p>The Rangers were kept in column just in the
rear of the left wing, and had no part in the conflict
till late in the day, when our eagerness to
take part in the fight was gratified by an order
to clear our extreme left, and assail the enemy,
who was then retiring through thick woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
We had to cross a muddy branch. At first two
abreast could get over, but it soon became so bad
that only one at a time could cross, and then it
was a good long jump for a horse. Not half of
the regiment was over when the leading files
rushed up the hill through a small open field.
Turning to the right they came to a high rail
fence behind which was a line of blue. From
this line came a most destructive fire which
emptied many saddles. John Crane of Company
D was killed. Clint Terry, a new arrival, brother
of our former colonel, fell mortally wounded.</p>

<p>We were too few to make any impression, although
some of our men dismounted and began
throwing down the fence. A few even crossed
into the wood. The firing was so hot that we
beat a hasty retreat in spite of the appeals of
Colonel Wharton and other officers, who did all
they could to stop our flight. We didn’t stop
until we were out of range, when we re-formed at
once. Thus our second encounter with the enemy
met with a repulse. I may say, however, that this
charge, if it be proper to call it a charge, was not
without good results to our cause. Several years
since I received a letter from Colonel Chisholm,
who was then on the staff of General Beauregard.
He wrote that it was he who led the regiment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
that advance; that the object of it was to detain
the enemy until other troops could be brought up;
that for this purpose the movement was measurably
successful.</p>

<p>That afternoon we learned with sorrow of the
death of General Johnston. This we then regarded
as a great calamity, and time has not
changed our opinion.</p>

<p>We were not engaged again that day. We
spent the night on the battlefield, amid the dead
of the enemy, subsisting ourselves and our horses
from the abundant supplies on every hand.
Though it rained another downpour, and though
we had no shelter, we slept as only tired soldiers
can.</p>

<p>Reinforced by Buell’s 40,000, the enemy assumed
the offensive next day. The Confederates
only resisted, as best they could, to get off their
wounded, their trains and artillery, over muddy
roads. The Rangers were dismounted to aid in
resisting the forward movement, losing several
men. John H. Washington of Company D was
shot through the hips and left on the field for
dead; but under the care of Federal surgeons he
recovered, and is living today.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the 8th, two companies of the Rangers,
under Major Harrison, with part of Forrest’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
men, all under the command of Forrest, made a
brilliant charge on a mounted force of the enemy,
believed to be a large escort of a general officer,
and ran them back to the main force of infantry.</p>

<p>The pursuit now ceased and, without further
molestation, we returned to Corinth. Here we
remained two or three weeks, and received some
recruits, the first since leaving Texas. Company
D got six, T. A. W. Hill, William and A. J. Kyle,
George T. McGehee, T. M. Rector and S. M.
Watkins. They were quite an addition to our
force. All were fine soldiers and continued to
the end. There was much sickness, caused by bad
water. Everybody was anxious for more active
service.</p>

<p>The regiment was now ordered into Tennessee.
Crossing the river at Lamb’s Ferry, we captured
a detachment of the enemy, guarding a railroad
bridge, after a hot fight, in which we lost several
men. Captain Harris of Company I was killed;
also William DeWoody of Company D. There
is one incident of this affair which I shall never
forget. Among our prisoners was a captain of
an Ohio regiment. He had six bullet wounds in
his body. He sat up in the boat as we crossed the
river, and walked unassisted up the hill on the
other side.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>FORREST AT MURFREESBORO.</h3>


<p>We were now ordered to Chattanooga. Here
we were placed in a brigade under the command
of Colonel N. B. Forrest. At this time but little
was known of this great soldier. He had not
then become famous, and there were not wanting
officers of high rank who predicted disaster as the
result of his operations. Without the advantages
of education, he possessed strong common sense,
unfaltering courage, energy that never flagged,
and unbounded confidence in himself. Under his
leadership our metal was not to grow rusty for
lack of employment.</p>

<p>Setting out from Chattanooga on the 8th of
July, we crossed the Tennessee river and the Cumberland
mountains into middle Tennessee. On
the 11th we reached McMinnville and remained
until the afternoon of the 12th. Here Forrest
made his regimental commanders acquainted with
his plans. His objective was Murfreesboro, over
forty miles away, garrisoned by a force of the
enemy estimated at 2000 men, under the command
of Brigadier General Crittenden.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we started for an all night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
ride. At Woodbury we halted and fed our horses,
resuming the march at midnight. We reached
the vicinity of Murfreesboro at daylight on
the 13th.</p>

<p>Now occurred one of those unfortunate blunders
which often mar the best laid plans; probably
made by Forrest himself. Colonel Wharton with
the Rangers was to attack a camp of the enemy on
the Liberty pike north of town. Forrest, who had
been riding at the head of the column, turned
aside to allow us to pass. When six companies
had gone by he fell in with his staff and escort.
Thus it happened that nearly half of the regiment
followed Forrest into the town and out to
the westward. The courthouse was garrisoned
by a company of the Ninth Michigan Infantry,
who poured a hot fire into our ranks from the
windows. Forrest and the Rangers rode on, but
the sound of firing had aroused the good ladies
from their beds; looking out they saw the dear
defenders of their cause. Without taking time
for very elaborate toilets, they rushed into the
streets just as the Georgians came up. Pointing
to the courthouse, they begged them to attack the
hated foe. With a “Hurrah for the women!”
these perfectly green troops dismounted, broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
down the doors, and captured the garrison, but
with severe loss.</p>

<p>When Forrest discovered that he had with him
only a handful of Rangers, he turned back to look
after the rest of his command. Captain Ferrell,
now the ranking officer, led us through the suburbs
of the town towards the right, or north
where he thought to find the regiment. While
we were passing through a field of standing corn,
the artillery of the enemy opened on us at short
range. The first shot struck William Skull of
Company G, taking off both legs and passing
through his horse, killing both instantly.</p>

<p>We found the main part of the regiment about
half a mile east of the town, on the road by which
we had come. They had made a spirited attack
on the enemy, but were too weak to get any favorable
results, and had retired, Wharton being
wounded. As soon as the regiment was united
Wharton sent the adjutant, M. H. Royston, and
ten men to report to Forrest for orders. I was
of this party. We found Forrest in the town. He
spoke with some show of irritation:</p>

<p>“Tell him to bring his men up here.”</p>

<p>During all this time he had been attacking the
enemy with the forces at hand, but there was
little result of a decisive nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Some of his chief officers had advised him to
be content with what he had already accomplished
and withdraw; but he was not of the withdrawing
kind. Preparing for a final assault, when the
Rangers came up, he delayed the attack long
enough to send a demand for surrender to the
camp of the Michigan regiment. This was
promptly agreed to. He now sent a like demand
to the Third Minnesota. Colonel Lester of that
regiment asked for an hour’s time and an opportunity
to consult with Colonel Duffield. This
officer was seriously wounded. Forrest allowed
half an hour and the privilege of the interview.
As Lester was going to the room of Colonel Duffield
opportunity was given him to see our
strength. When the half hour was up he surrendered
his entire force.</p>

<p>The troops surrendered consisted of fifteen companies
of infantry, six of the Ninth Michigan and
nine of the Third Minnesota; seven companies of
cavalry, four of the Fourth Kentucky and three
of the Seventh Pennsylvania; and two sections
(four guns) of Hewett’s battery: in all 1765
men.</p>

<p>The brigade commander, General Crittenden,
was found hiding in a room at a tavern.</p>

<p>The spoil was immense; a large number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
wagons, with military stores and equipment of
all sorts.</p>

<p>The merits of this enterprise are very great, but
it must be admitted that had the enemy all been
together, under a resolute commander, they could
have beaten us. They had nearly 1800 men of
all arms, infantry, cavalry and artillery&mdash;a miniature
army&mdash;while Forrest had a little over 1300
men, some of them absolutely green troops.</p>

<p>In regard to this affair, General Buell, commanding
the department, published a very caustic
order, of which a short extract is here given:</p>

<p>“Take it in all its features, few more disgraceful
examples of neglect of duty and lack of good
conduct can be found in the history of wars. It
fully merits the extreme penalty which the law
provides for such conduct. The force was more
than sufficient to repel the attack effectually.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>MANY MARCHES AND SKIRMISHES&mdash;THE KENTUCKY
CAMPAIGN.</h3>


<p>We rested at McMinnville three or four days,
and then started a hard ride with little rest for
Lebanon, a distance of fifty miles, intending to
surprise and capture a force of 500 cavalry stationed
there. On the morning of the 20th we
dashed into the place, but the enemy had been
warned and had left in a hurry for Nashville.</p>

<p>We remained one day and night in this beautiful
little city, recipients of the unbounded hospitality
of its splendid people. They fed us on poultry,
roast pig, ham, cakes and pies like “mother
used to make,” and filled our haversacks for the
march.</p>

<p>From Lebanon our route was by “The Hermitage,”
so long the home of Andrew Jackson. Here
a short halt was made, and many of the men visited
the house and grounds. Mounting, we moved on to
Stone river, seven miles from Nashville, where a
small picket force was captured. Thence we crossed
over to the Murfreesboro turnpike, only four miles
from the city, and destroyed four railroad bridges,
capturing the guards&mdash;in all about 120 men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
We then turned off in the direction of Lebanon,
and camped for the night after riding for a few
miles; here we paroled our prisoners. Passing
around Murfreesboro we marched to McMinnville,
where we rested till the 10th of August.</p>

<p>We then advanced to the line of railroad, captured
the pickets and burned a few bridges. The
enemy had now begun to erect stockades for their
guards at the bridges. There was one not yet
finished, and Forrest tried to capture it but failed.
Captain Houston of Company G was killed in
this attack.</p>

<p>Moving in the direction of Altamont we camped
in a cove near the mountain. The enemy advanced
in force on all the roads. We had to take
the dry bed of a creek which ran parallel to one
of the roads on which the enemy was advancing.
We traveled in this creek a mile or two, and then
emerged into the open. A battery of the enemy,
on the McMinnville road, not more than 600
yards away, opened fire upon us. The very best
of troops, who will charge anything, are often
thrown into a panic by an attack from an unexpected
quarter. We broke into a run and were
soon out of range, though in considerable disorder.</p>

<p>Marching leisurely to Sparta, we joined forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
with Bragg’s army, then on the move into Kentucky.
Forrest was ordered to guard the left
flank and harass the rear of the enemy in his retreat
to Nashville. We came up to their rear
guard at Woodbury, and chased them clear up
to Murfreesboro, but could only run them through
the place.</p>

<p>Bragg soon moved by Glasgow and on to Mumfordsville,
getting in ahead of Buell and on his
line of march. He had a strong position, but for
some unaccountable reason turned off and let the
Federal army pass on to Louisville. Forrest kept
on the left and in close touch with the enemy till
the army turned aside, when we went on to the
vicinity of Louisville. Forrest was now relieved
and ordered to Tennessee, and Colonel John A.
Wharton was placed in command of the brigade.
We kept close up to Louisville, in observation of
the enemy’s movements. Had a small but spirited
skirmish at Mt. Washington, as related in the introduction.</p>

<p>Early in October Buell began to move with
some vigor. An enterprising brigade of cavalry
got between us and our main army. They took
position at Bardstown and thus we were “cut off.”
When intelligence of this move reached Wharton
he called in his outposts, threw his command into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
column, Rangers in front, Company D leading.
At a gallop we started for the seat of trouble.
The enemy had chosen a strong position at the
mouth of the lane in which we were traveling,
and had their courage been equal to their enterprise
they could have given us a warm entertainment.
When we came in sight of them our bugle
sounded the charge and we went at them as fast
as our horses could carry us. They broke almost
at once, firing only a few shots. It was now a
chase for miles. We caught over 200 of them,
and strewed the woods with their dead and
wounded. General George H. Thomas, of the
Federal army, says they lost about “twenty killed
and wounded, and a great many missing”; these
“missing” were our prisoners. Our loss was small&mdash;I
can not recall the casualties. It was one of
the softest snaps in the way of a fight that we
had during the war.</p>

<p>Some amusing incidents nearly always occur,
but the laughter rarely takes place till all danger
is past. After the long chase we, as well as the
enemy, were very much scattered. John B. Rector
seeing a lone Federal, rushed up and demanded
his surrender. “Surrender yourself,” replied the
man, leveling his pistol. Now Rector had discharged
every chamber of his pistol and promptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
complied. Just then Bill Davis dashed up. He
was a large, fierce looking man, on a powerful
horse not less than sixteen and a half hands high.
He broke out, “John, why the &mdash;&mdash; don’t you
disarm that &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; Yankee?” “I am a prisoner
myself, Bill.” Quick as a flash Davis was
at the fellow’s side and bringing his pistol against
his head broke out, “Give up them pistols, you
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; blue-bellied &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.” The shooting
irons were promptly handed over and the
prisoner escorted to the rear.</p>

<p>In the language of the great American game it
was pure “bluff” all around for all the firearms
were empty, but Bill Davis was always loaded to
the muzzle with quick firing profanity which he
could discharge in rattling volleys on the slightest
provocation. I am glad to say, however, that
he no longer goes loaded thus, for he has been
a strict churchman for several years.</p>

<p>General Bragg published a general order highly
laudatory of the Rangers for this affair, but I
have found no record of it. It was read to the
regiment and complimented us in high terms.</p>

<p>Bragg’s army was widely dispersed, gathering
supplies in that fertile section. Buell was pressing
him, and to get time for concentration, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to get his train out of the way, we made a stand
at Perryville, where, on the 8th of October, was
fought one of the fiercest combats of the war.
Fourteen thousand Confederates kept at bay for
nearly two days the immense army of the enemy,
but with heavy loss to both sides. Wharton’s
brigade held the extreme right and did a full
share of the fighting. Among our killed was
Major Mark Evans of the Rangers. Captain Ferrell
of Company D succeeded him, and Lieutenant
Kyle of Company D became captain.</p>

<p>I was in the battle of Perryville, not with
the regiment, but in a small detachment on the
left while the Rangers were on the right. Hence
I avail myself of the description of “Perryville”
given by A. B. Briscoe, who kindly placed his
“Personal Memoirs” at my service.</p>

<p>“The enemy was on the west side of the creek
and our army on the east. The valley between
was open field and the tops of the hills covered in
places with timber. It was an ideal battlefield;
there were no breastworks, but the hills on both
sides were crowned with artillery. Polk was in
command of the Confederate forces and expected
the enemy to attack and waited for them until
about 2 p. m. In the meantime the artillery was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
making the very earth tremble with a duel of
nearly 100 guns. We lay in a little valley a few
hundred yards to the rear, partially sheltered from
this storm of shells. At 2 p. m. we were moved
in column through the lines of infantry and the
smoking batteries to the front. The open valley
was before us with a deep creek spanned by a
wooden bridge. Down we charged in column of
fours across the bridge. After crossing, each
squadron formed left front into line, which made
us present five lines, one behind the other, and in
this order we charged up the hill, into the woods
and among the Yankees. This whole movement
was made in a sweeping gallop and as if on
parade. How different from the way we were
handled at Shiloh! The Yankees were brushed
back from the hill and woods and when the bugle
sounded the recall and we returned, our own infantry
and artillery had crossed the creek and
were taking position on the hills from which we
had driven the enemy. But again we had lost
our commander, the gallant Lieutenant Colonel
Mark Evans, who fell mortally wounded at the
head of the regiment.”</p>

<p>I have copied this literally, but I am of the
opinion that Evans was only major.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Bragg had secured the needed time. He now
started for Cumberland Gap, leaving the cavalry
to protect his rear and retard, as best they could,
the onward march of the enemy. Colonel Joseph
Wheeler was made chief of cavalry and had command
of all in the rear. The country was timbered,
broken, not very fertile, affording little in
the way of food for man or beast. We had to
form line and skirmish several times a day. The
service was very trying. For more than a week
there was no order to unsaddle.</p>

<p>At last Buell gave up the pursuit and started
to Nashville. We went on through Cumberland
Gap to Knoxville, where we had a snowstorm.
From Knoxville, by Kingston and over the mountains,
we went to Sparta, Murfreesboro and Nolensville.
At Nolensville we had a position on
the left of the army. Here some promotions were
announced. Colonel Wharton became a brigadier
general, his commission dating from the Bardstown
fight, the 4th of October. Harrison became
colonel, Ferrell, lieutenant colonel, and Gustave
Cook, major. Ferrell was soon compelled to resign
on account of bad health. Cook then became
lieutenant colonel and S. Pat Christian, major.
In Company D, Dechard became first lieutenant
and W. R. Black, second lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
We remained at Nolensville nearly two months,
picketing and scouting. We passed our second
Christmas, a serious and sober set, thinking of
the homes and loved ones far away, and wondering
if we should ever see them again.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>MURFREESBORO.</h3>


<p>The enemy did not allow us much time for
repining. Promptly on the 26th they moved out
in force. We were sent forward to develop their
strength. The regiment, under the command of
Captain Kyle, was drawn up in a field and dismounted.
Our leader conducted us over a high
rail fence into an open wood of cedar trees. We
went along listening to his encouraging words
until we reached the top of a slight rise. Just
over the crest was a solid line of infantry lying
down. Kyle at once ordered a retreat. At least
that’s what he meant, though the words he actually
used are not in the manual. He said:</p>

<p>“Get out of here, men! There’s a whole brigade!”</p>

<p>We understood him and so did the Yankees,
who sprang to their feet and delivered a volley,
doing little damage. The high fence had not
seemed a serious obstacle as we went in, but when
I got back to it on the return, with bullets striking
it like hail on a roof, it looked very formidable.
I sprang up on it and just fell off on the other
side. When I got up the command was moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
off rapidly. I had started to the rear as soon as
the others, but they outran me, and I didn’t
“throw” the race either. I turned to the left,
down the line of fence, climbed another, and was
now reasonably safe but nearly exhausted. I had
still to go half a mile before I reached the command.
My saddle felt mighty good and restful.</p>

<p>It was now plain that it was a general advance
of the enemy, and Bragg prepared for the battle
of Murfreesboro, whither we now marched
promptly. In the line Wharton’s brigade occupied
the left. When the ball opened in earnest
he led this command around the right of the
enemy’s line, and within 600 yards of Rosecrans’
headquarters attacked and captured a wagon train
going to the rear. We could not hold it long;
but we captured a four-gun battery and held on
to that; moved down toward Nashville and ran
into the train again.</p>

<p>In these operations Company D lost two killed,
Sam Friedberger and Wayne Hamilton. Kenner
Rector was wounded. John W. Hill and P. J.
Watkins were made prisoners. Hill’s horse was
killed as we were retiring before superior numbers.
He was away three or four months, and greatly
missed, for he was a good one.</p>

<p>After a strenuous day of it, with a good many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
prisoners and the four guns, we returned to the
army and were sent to the right, taking position
on the right of Breckenridge’s line. We saw that
gallant officer and his splendid division move forward
through an open field with the precision of
parade, under a furious cannonading from the
Federal batteries strongly posted in a cedar wood.
The shells plowed great gaps through their ranks.
When the colors fell other hands seized them and
bore them onward. When they reached the position
of the enemy they wavered and began to give
way, in order at first, but as they retreated under
a distressing fire of artillery and musketry, they
broke into a run. We stood there and could not
help them, although every man of us would have
gone to their aid with a whoop.</p>

<p>This charge deserves to rank with Malvern
Hill, Franklin, and other useless sacrifices of life.
Like the charge of the light brigade, “it was magnificent,
but it was not war.”</p>

<p>This was Bragg’s final effort, and he withdrew
from the contest. The only tactics he seems to
have learned was to wait till the enemy came up
to his lines and fortified himself; then attack and
lose more men than the enemy, then sneak away.
He had heard somewhere that “he who fights and
runs away may live to fight another day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Bragg stopped at Shelbyville. Rosecrans was
content to stay at Murfreesboro, begging his government
for more cavalry; nor did he feel safe
in advancing till he had a large addition to his
mounted force.</p>

<p>We took position on the left of the army, picketing
and scouting the front, with occasional skirmishes
and reconnoissances.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE DONELSON TRIP AND RETREAT TO CHATTANOOGA.</h3>


<p>Just who conceived this wild-goose chase, I am
not informed. For suffering, hardships, and barrenness
of results, it is only exceeded by Napoleon’s
Russian campaign. On the 25th of January,
General Wheeler, in command of the brigades
of Wharton and Forrest, took up the line
of march for Dover, or Fort Donelson. I do not
know how to describe the weather, except in the
language of the grammar on the comparison of
adjectives: cold, colder, coldest. We crossed one
little stream fifteen or twenty times in one day.
The water froze on the legs of our horses until
they were encased in ice above the knees; their
tails were solid chunks of ice, while we had to
walk to keep warm. Men and horses suffered
intensely.</p>

<p>When we reached the vicinity of Dover, Forrest
reported to Wheeler that he had but a scant
supply of ammunition; and investigation disclosed
the fact that Wharton’s brigade was little better
off in this regard. Forrest did not hesitate to
advise withdrawal of our forces without attempt
at action, but Wheeler determined to proceed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Forrest attacked from the north and east, carried
the enemy’s outer works, and drove them into
the redoubts, but with great loss of life. His ammunition
was now exhausted, and he was compelled
to fall back. Wharton attacked from the
Donelson side, and captured one brass field gun,
but he, too, was compelled to retire because his
ammunition was running low. The Rangers had
been sent out on the Fort Henry road before these
operations were begun and so had no part in the
assault.</p>

<p>Jordan, in his “Life of Forrest,” says:</p>

<p>“The Confederate losses were heavy. Forrest
had one-fourth of his force, or 200 of his officers
and men killed, wounded and captured, and Wharton’s
casualties did not fall short of sixty killed
and wounded.”</p>

<p>Now the retreat began. All the command, except
the Rangers, practically out of ammunition.
The weather did not moderate. The second or
third night a report reached Wheeler that a heavy
column of the enemy, cavalry and infantry, under
General Jeff C. Davis, had left Nashville to head
him off. About midnight we were ordered to saddle
up. It was so cold that if we touched a gun-barrel
or bridle bit our hands stuck to the metal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and we had to put those bits into the mouths of
our poor horses.</p>

<p>We reached Duck river about daylight, and
found it bank full, the surface covered with floating
ice. After some search a ford was found and
we crossed to the south side. As Davis’ command
did not show up, we went into camp and warmed
ourselves a little. After a rest of a day or two
we moved leisurely back to our old position.</p>

<p>I do not know what could have been accomplished
by this expedition beyond the capture of
a small garrison. Certainly the suffering and the
losses of men and horses were very great. For a
long time when the men wanted to reach the
superlative of suffering they spoke of the Donelson
trip.</p>

<p>In April we moved over to the right and
camped a few days at Sparta. The regiment captured
a mail train between Murfreesboro and
Nashville, getting about a dozen officers. The
men rifled the mail sacks and amused themselves
reading the letters of the Yankees. They obtained
also a considerable amount of greenbacks;
also a silver-mounted pistol, said to belong to
General Rosecrans. My horse was lame and so
I missed this expedition&mdash;and my share of the
greenbacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Toward the last of June the Federal army, having
received reinforcements, including heavy additions
to its cavalry force, began another forward
movement. The Rangers were dismounted
to skirmish with the advance. During this action
a heavy rainstorm came up; we thought this
would suspend the affair, but when the rain ceased
we found the Yankees had advanced their lines
considerably. Regarding this as a violation of
the rules of the game, we mounted and rode off.</p>

<p>Their cavalry now showed unusual spirit and
audacity, pressing us pretty close. On the 4th
of July, at the site of the present University of
the South, the Rangers had to charge and drive
them back. The retreat was continued across the
mountains and the Tennessee river to Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The Rangers took position at Rome, Georgia.
There we had a few weeks’ needed rest and recruited
our jaded horses. Roasting ears were in
season, fruit was beginning to ripen, and so we
feasted on good things. The runabouts&mdash;“pie
rooters” we called them&mdash;made the best of their
opportunities. Bill Arp said they found every
road in the county, and then some.</p>

<p>Dr. Bunting, our chaplain, started a series of
meetings, and many embraced the opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
pledge themselves to the better life. The boys,
from their scant pay, contributed money to buy
a horse for General John A. Wharton. The presentation
speech was made by John B. Rector,
Wharton replying. Both speakers pledged the
last drop of their blood, etc. Same old story, but
a trifle stale by this time.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>CHICKAMAUGA.</h3>


<p>Rosecrans maneuvered Bragg out of Chattanooga.
He now seemed to have a contempt for
his adversary, and divided his army into three
columns in an effort to bring ours to bay. One
crossed the mountains and took position at
Alpine, forty miles south of the center, evidently
to gain the rear of the Confederates.</p>

<p>We were sent to look after this column. <a id="Lieutenant"></a>Lieutenant
Baylor of the Rangers reported to Wharton
that a heavy force of infantry was at Alpine.
Wharton reported this to Bragg with a note
vouching for Baylor’s reliability. Bragg broke
out:</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Baylor lies: there is no infantry
south of us!”</p>

<p>In a day or two, however, he became convinced
that the report was true, and made some feeble
effort to attack them in detail. Nothing came of
it except that Rosecrans, who now discovered that
his enemy was not retreating so precipitately,
took the alarm and began to concentrate his
widely separated columns. The force at Alpine
had to cross the mountains. It took them two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
days to get to the center, now menaced by the
Confederates. Imagine Stonewall Jackson in
Bragg’s place!</p>

<p>Of the larger events of the battle of Chickamauga
I shall treat very briefly. It has been
truthfully called the soldiers’ battle. Whatsoever
of strategy or generalship there had been had miscarried
and the two armies stood face to face for
a trial of strength: a test of manhood. The numbers
were about equal, not far from 70,000 on a
side. The Federals had the advantage of position,
which they had fortified. The Confederates
had to attack. Never was fiercer attack and defense.
Never was shown greater courage.</p>

<p>The enemy were driven from their works, but
with frightful loss to the Confederates. Their
killed numbered 2389. The wounded 13,412;
while the Federals’ loss in killed was 1656,
wounded, 9769. It was such dearly bought and
fruitless victories as this which finally defeated
the South.</p>

<p>The Terry Rangers were on the extreme left of
the line and were ordered to drive the enemy from
their front. This order was executed in handsome
style. The enemy proved to be our old antagonists,
the Third Ohio Cavalry. After the charge
a message was <a id="brought"></a>brought to Lieutenant Dechard, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the Rangers, that a wounded Federal officer wished
to see him. He rode to the spot and dismounted.
When he saw the wounded man, he said:</p>

<p>“Why, it’s my old friend, Major Cupp. I am
sorry to see you thus.”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Colonel Cupp,” replied the other,
“but I’ve had my last promotion. You people
have got me this time.”</p>

<p>More than a year before, these officers, each a
lieutenant in command of an escort for a flag of
truce, had met. They met again, a few weeks
later, under the same circumstances, but Cupp
was now a captain. After the fight in Bardstown
Dechard was in command of the guard for the
prisoners, and recognized his former acquaintance.
“Captain Cupp, I am glad to see you,” said he.</p>

<p>“Major Cupp,” corrected the prisoner, “but I
can not say that I am glad to see you under the
circumstances.”</p>

<p>As the cartel was still in force, he was soon exchanged,
and as we have seen when he fell, Dechard
was near. These facts were related to me by
Dechard himself, and he was known to be perfectly
reliable. These incidents confirm the old
adage, “Truth is stranger than fiction.”</p>

<p>The dying officer desired Dechard to take his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
watch and other belongings and send them to his
relatives in Ohio, which was done a few days
later by flag of truce.</p>

<p>Wheeler and Forrest followed the discomfited
Federals up to Chattanooga. Here it was remembered
that two detachments under Lieutenants
Friend and Batchelor had been left on picket in
gaps of the mountain away to the left of the battlefield,
and I was ordered to go to them at once
and direct them to join the command, which
would be found on the Athens road.</p>

<p>There was about an hour of daylight, and I
hoped to pass the ground of the terrible struggle
before night, knowing that there was nothing for
me or my horse until I did so. In this I was disappointed.
Darkness came on shortly after I
reached the scene of that awful carnage. Many
of the Federal dead and wounded still lay where
they had fallen. The air was freighted with a
horrible odor, the battlefield’s commentary on
war. The wounded hearing my horse’s footfalls,
began calling me to give some assistance. Dismounting
I picked my way to the first one. He
desired to be turned over. Another wanted his
canteen. The poor fellow had struggled while
there was strength, and now unable to move further,
was out of reach of his canteen. These were
relieved and others not specially remembered here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
It seemed that hundreds were calling. I was ever
a coward in the presence of suffering, besides duty
required that I should proceed on my journey.
So I asked:</p>

<p>“Are you aware that your own surgeons with
their details and ambulances are here uncontrolled
on the field?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” was the answer, “they come around
every day and leave us water, a little food and
medicine, but it is awful to lie here this way.”</p>

<p>I mounted and rode off, feeling sad at the fate
of these men dying unattended hundreds of miles
from home and loved ones, but I steeled my heart
by the thought that if they had stayed at home
with their loved ones they would not be thus
dying.</p>

<p>I was now lost. It was dark and my horse
could not follow any road, for roads were everywhere.
Artillery wheels make many roads on a
battlefield. After a while I saw a light and went
to it. It was the camp fire of the details for the
care of the wounded. These men sat around.
The ambulances and mules were near. There
was a little house, too. On the porch I saw some
officers in uniform. Surgeons they were. I inquired
for some resident. A slender girl came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the door and in reply to my request directed me
to Lee and Gordon’s mill.</p>

<p>The moon was now rising. I was on that part
of the field from which the dead and wounded
had been removed, but there was wreck and ruin
everywhere. Maimed and groaning horses, and
no one to waste a load of ammunition to end their
suffering; broken gun carriages, the debris of a
battlefield.</p>

<p>I crossed and watered my horse in the stream
at the mill. As I rode up the hill I met two of
my own company, who had been at the wagon
camp cooking for the company. When they
learned how far it was to the command and the
horrors of the battlefield, they readily agreed to
camp, for it was now late. So I had supper, for
my comrades had sacks of bread and bacon, but
my poor horse had nothing. We lay down and
slept under the shining moon, although but a
few miles away hundreds of human beings lay
dying.</p>

<p>On the morrow I proceeded on my journey.
When I reached the first detachment under Lieutenant
Friend and delivered my message, he
kindly sent one of his men on to tell Batchelor:
gave me some forage for my horse, and all gathered
around anxious for news of the battle. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
they had been in sound of the mighty struggle,
the boom of the great guns, even the rattle of
small arms, while their comrades were in dire
peril, but denied the privilege of sharing in their
danger or triumph. They had heard that the
enemy had been driven from the field, but had
heard nothing from their own command. They
were hungry for news from the Rangers. What
part they took, and who were killed or wounded?
For they knew if the Rangers had been engaged
somebody was hurt.</p>

<p>These occurrences took place nearly forty-eight
years ago, and yet their memory is clear in my
mind, and when I think of my lonely ride in
Chickamauga’s gloomy woods, of the dead and
dying, the wreck and ruin of that awful night,
I am convinced that there is no more expressive
definition of war than General Sherman has given.</p>

<p>When Batchelor’s squad came up we started to
overtake the command, joining it on the following
day, as well as I remember. It was then well
on its way to the Federal rear in middle Tennessee.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>WHEELER’S GREAT RAID.</h3>


<p>Our march was up the Holston river to find
an unguarded ford, but the pickets were everywhere.
We halted in a field at night, and Company
D, armed with picks and spades, was
directed to go to the river bank and there make
a way for the artillery. A guide from the vicinity
showed us a way across, by a ford unknown
to the Yankees. We captured a few pickets.</p>

<p>Wheeler now divided his forces, himself leading
a column into Sequatchie valley, where he captured
and burned 2000 wagons. He then overtook
the remainder of the command as we descended
the mountains. Our route was by McMinnville
and Murfreesboro, and the way was sufficiently
familiar to us, since we had traveled it
so often under Forrest the year before.</p>

<p>When we reached the vicinity of Murfreesboro,
Captain Kyle with his squadron, consisting of
Companies D and F, was ordered to ride around
the place, reach the railroad leading to Nashville,
and try to capture a train. We came to the railroad
a little before daylight, but there were no
trains running; the enemy had learned that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
“rebels” were in the country. Captain Kyle heard
of a lot of wagons down toward Nashville and
decided to take them in. This he did without
resistance. The teams had been engaged in hauling
wood to the garrison at Nashville, and the
wagons were drawn by oxen, the only instance of
this kind that we saw during the war. The oxen
being fat, and also too slow of foot to go with us
in any other form, were converted into beef.</p>

<p>We crossed over to Shelbyville pike, the scene
of some of our operations in the spring. Learning
that a small force of cavalry held Shelbyville,
General Wharton ordered the Rangers to attempt
their capture. We saddled up early, and rode
briskly, reaching there about daylight, but the
enemy had left. There were several stores in this
place, established by some enterprising Yankees,
and stocked with clothing and dry goods. Rather
than have their doors broken down, the owners
opened them. Winter was coming on, we were a
long way from home and nearly naked, and here
was our chance for winter supplies. Some of the
boys got a black “Prince Albert” coat. This was
presented to the chaplain, who wore it a long time.</p>

<p>The line of march led by Farmington. Here
the enemy had taken a strong position in a cedar
thicket. Over the ground were scattered large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
boulders. The enemy, armed with Spencer
rifles, were lying behind these stones. The
Rangers were ordered to charge this position.
We got up pretty close; in fact, into the
edge of the thicket; but they poured such
a destructive fire into us that it did not take us
long to discover that we had more than we could
handle. We took some prisoners. We also got
some of these rifles, the first of the kind I had
ever seen; they would shoot seven times without
reloading. The casualties are not remembered, except
that Major Christian and Lieutenant Blackburn
were wounded. Love, of Company C, was
killed.</p>

<p>That night at headquarters they were discussing
the incidents of the day. Wharton said the
Rangers had done all that any soldiers could do;
that it was impossible for mounted troops to drive
brave men, armed as were the enemy, from such
a position. General Wheeler said they had done
all that he expected; had held the enemy engaged
while our artillery and wagons ran by through a
field, thus saving the command from a bad situation.
Then Colonel Harrison spoke:</p>

<p>“It was no fight at all! I’m ashamed of them!
If they can not do better than that I’ll disown
them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
A staff officer put in:</p>

<p>“I always thought that regiment somewhat
overrated anyhow.”</p>

<p>This aroused “old Tom,” who got up, shook
his finger in the fellow’s face and broke out furiously:</p>

<p>“Who the &mdash;&mdash; are you? There is not a man
in that regiment who can not kick you all over
this yard, sir!”</p>

<p>As he strode off to his horse, he was heard to
say:</p>

<p>“By &mdash;&mdash; I’ll curse them all I want to; but I’ll
be &mdash;&mdash; if anybody else shall do it in my presence!”</p>

<p>Moving on to the Tennessee river, we crossed
that stream at one of the fords along the Mussel
Shoals. From there, in a more leisurely manner,
we went back to the army, still besieging the Federals

<h3>EAST TENNESSEE CAMPAIGN.</h3>


<p>Bragg felt so sure that Rosecrans would be
starved into surrender that he dispatched Longstreet
to Knoxville to take in the garrison stationed
there. Our division, commanded by General
Martin, was sent along with him. Longstreet
laid siege to the place. We were transferred from
one side of the river to the other, fording the
freezing water at night. We had a little skirmish
on College hill; details not remembered, except
that Lieutenant Black was wounded.</p>

<p>It was reported that the “loyal” people up the
river were in the habit of loading small boats
with provisions, setting them adrift to float down
the river for the use of the garrison in Knoxville,
the boats being caught by a boom across the
stream. Someone conceived the brilliant idea
that if trees were cut down and rolled into the
river above, they would float down and break the
boom. Our regiment, placed temporarily under
the command of somebody’s staff officer anxious
to distinguish himself, was detailed for this
service. A worse selection could hardly have been
made for the performance of such work. Prob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>ably
not one man in twenty was possessed with
any skill with the ax. Young men raised on the
prairies, professional men, boys from the stores,
sons of planters, who had slaves to do their chopping,
composed this force of axmen. Night, a
very dark night at that, was the time selected for
the exploit. A light drizzle was falling. Imagine
anybody trying to cut down trees under such circumstances!
The staff colonel in command
stopped at a house where there was a blazing fire,
dismounted, and took a comfortable seat. The
regiment went up on the hillside and hacked away
for hours. I believe some trees were actually
felled, chopped into convenient lengths, and rolled
into the stream and appeared to sink in the water.
All suffered from the cold. It was such foolish
services as this that tended to demoralize the Confederate
soldier and sap a man’s courage and
patriotism as nothing else will. There is something
inspiring in a charge, albeit there is danger,
too, with comrades falling all around; but spirited
troops would choose a charge every time rather
than such imbecile business as that midnight tree-cutting
exploit.</p>

<p>When the Confederate army was driven from
Missionary Ridge, Longstreet was compelled to
raise the siege of Knoxville. He retired to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
eastward, taking position on the East Tennessee
and Virginia railroad, near Morristown, if I remember
correctly, the cavalry guarding his front.</p>

<p>The cold was intense. The people, in sympathy
with the enemy, furnished them with excellent
guides to any exposed position of ours. Hence
we had to be exceedingly vigilant. Imagine going
on picket at 2 a. m. with temperature at zero or
below; but the army must sleep, and the cavalry
must guard the outposts. We had also numerous
skirmishes, but I can not remember the details
of them.</p>

<p>A letter written by me to my parents dated
January 4, 1864, enumerates six fights during
November and December in which the regiment
lost twenty-seven killed and wounded; one on the
road to Cumberland Gap. This was early in
November. We chased some cavalry several miles,
taking a dozen or more prisoners and wounding
a few without a single casualty on our side, unless
someone’s ears were frost bitten, for it was a very
cold morning and a biting wind raged.</p>

<p>We had three or four skirmishes near Mossy
creek. In one of these, on December 26, 1863,
Captain G. W. Littlefield was badly wounded by
a large fragment of a shell which lacerated his
left hip for a space five or six inches by twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
or thirteen. It looked like a mortal hurt. A
strong constitution pulled him through, yet he
was compelled to retire from the service, and even
now (1911) suffers from the wound.</p>

<p>On the 29th of December we were ordered to
drive a force of the enemy who were dismounted
and lying behind a large brick residence and the
outbuildings. We had to break down the garden
fence, which we did by forcing our horses against
it. We drove them all right, took a few prisoners,
but sustained serious losses ourselves. In Company
D, N. J. Allen was killed outright. Richard
Berger was shot through the face, losing the
sight of one eye, and William Nicholson had a
slight scalp wound. There was another on the
24th, near the same place, and one near Dandridge,
but I am unable to recall the incidents,
although the letter referred to says that I participated
in all of them. In all we sustained
serious loss, and so far as I can see without any
appreciable effect on the campaign; but as Forrest
said, “War means fight, and fight means kill.”
Besides our blood was up and life held cheaply.</p>

<p>One little engagement, all one-sided, and as far
as we were concerned, was more amusing than
serious. Our brigade under Colonel Harrison,
and an Alabama brigade commanded by General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
John T. Morgan, so long a Senator from Alabama
after the war, were out on separate roads
which, however, came together some distance in
the rear of our position. The Alabama brigade,
attacked by the enemy, gave way. We were called
back, and when we reached the junction of the
roads the enemy was passing in hot pursuit. In
columns of fours we took them in flank, killed a
few, took several prisoners and scattered the remainder,
for they were so completely surprised
that they made no resistance. They were Brownlow’s
brigade of East Tennessee Cavalry and
rather shabby soldiers. We had no casualties.</p>

<p>The service was very arduous; besides the picketing
alluded to above, foraging became very
laborious. The country along the streams is
quite fertile and produced abundantly of food
for man and beast, but cavalry troops consume
rapidly, and the valleys were soon exhausted.
So we had to go away out into the mountains for
supplies. Often wagons could not go the roads
and we had to bring supplies on our horses over
mountain trails for ten or fifteen miles. These
expeditions were not without danger, for these
rude mountaineers were good shots, and lying in
the woods, did not see their bread and meat taken
with kind feelings. They sometimes fired on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
these foraging parties, but at long range from
mountain crag or other secure position, and I
believe injured no one.</p>

<p>As I am not relating these things in chronological
order, this will be a good place to set down
the facts concerning the night alarm on the banks
of Pigeon river. We were in camp for several
days on the banks of this stream which, though
small to be called a river, was yet rather deep at
that place; though it could be forded, as will be
seen.</p>

<p>Across from our encampment, some two or
three hundred yards from the banks, was a stately
mansion, the home of a wealthy and refined family.
I think the people’s name was Smith, but I
am not sure. The name will do anyhow. The
head of the family, a general or colonel, was away
from home, with the army no doubt. The family
at the house consisted of the mother and three or
four daughters, all charming ladies. They had
secured a house guard to protect them from insult.
Joe Rogers, being a little indisposed, was duly installed
as guard. This meant good times for Joe;
a bed to sleep in, three meals a day with plate,
knife and fork, a stable for his black horse Nig,
of which, by the way, he was very fond.</p>

<p>It was not long before the society men of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
regiment acquired the habit of slipping out after
evening roll call to enjoy a game of cards at General
Smith’s. One night several of them, a lieutenant,
a clerk of the quartermaster’s department,
and one or two others, crossed the river in a small
skiff and were soon pleasantly engaged in the
fascinating game of euchre with the young ladies.
Suddenly there was a cry of “Halt! Halt!” and
pistol shots rang out on the night air. Out went
the lights, and the visitors rushed for doors and
windows, knocking over chairs, tables, and even
the young women. They rushed to the river,
plunged in and across, and made for their companies.
The first alarm was plainly heard in the
camp. Sharp orders to “saddle up” were given
and repeated from company to company, and the
brigade was soon in line. Colonel Harrison sent
Tom Gill and a small party to ascertain the cause
of the row. Tom passed General Smith’s, where
all was dark, and went on to the picket stand.
Pickets reported all quiet; no enemy had passed
their post. Tom returned to the house, where he
met Joe Rogers. It appeared that Joe had not
run with the others at the first alarm. He had
gone out the back way to look after Nig and his
equipment. While getting these he heard voices,
accompanied with laughter, and the voices seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
somewhat familiar. Peeping around the house
he soon ascertained that the alarm had been
caused by three or four Rangers. He reported the
cause of the disturbance to Gill and his scouting
party, and Gill reported it to Colonel Harrison.</p>

<p>“The old man” was furious at first, for a false
alarm in war is a serious matter and a grave
offense. However, after some reflection, he concluded
to drop the matter, as he thought the incident
would have a wholesome effect on the guilty
parties. The men did not so easily let it drop.
Frequently at night for some months afterwards
someone would call out:</p>

<p>“Who waded Pigeon?”</p>

<p>From some other part of the camp the answer
would come:</p>

<p>“Murray! Brownson!”</p>

<p>The story got into the comic papers and caused
some amusement and some mortification to the
victims of the joke. John Haynie, one of the best
soldiers in the regiment, was the leader of the
alarmist jokers. If I ever learned the names of
the others I have forgotten them.</p>

<p>We had now been in the service for considerably
over two years, and there had been no general
system of furloughs. Our regiment might have
fifteen if they would re-enlist, but as we had al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>ready
enlisted for the war we could hardly perform
this condition. However, it was demanded
that we make declaration of our intention to continue
in the service. Some of us considered this
a reflection on our honor, and decided to do without
the coveted furloughs. Then some of the boys
got together, made a speech or two, passed a preamble
and resolutions, declaring we would never&mdash;no
never&mdash;quit as long as an armed foe trod our
sacred soil. This was considered satisfactory at
headquarters, and the furloughs were ordered.
Lots were drawn for the three assigned to Company
D. These fell to D. S. Combs, I. V. Jones
and J. F. McGuire, who left at once to visit their
homes.</p>

<p>At that time the enemy was at the mouth of
the Rio Grande. They evidently intended to invade
the country far enough to break up a most
profitable trade between the States west of the
Mississippi and the outside world by way of
Mexico. This traffic was carried on by means of
wagons, hundreds of which went in a constant
stream to the Rio Grande, loaded with cotton,
and brought back supplies of all kinds. The
people feared the enemy would penetrate the interior,
as the State had been stripped of its defenders.
Every persuasion was used to prevail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
on these men to remain on this side, and they
finally agreed to stay. The lieutenant general
commanding the department readily agreed to
the arrangement, and thus Company D lost three
good soldiers. We could not blame them, for,
given the opportunity, every one of us perhaps
would have done the same thing.</p>

<p>It was during this winter that one of the saddest
events of all our career happened; the hanging
of E. S. Dodd by the enemy. He was a member
of Company D. He was of a good family and
well educated. For many years he kept a diary,
setting down at night the happenings of the day.
He was taken prisoner with this diary in his
pocket. On that evidence alone he was condemned
and executed as a spy.</p>

<p>Spring was now approaching. Those masters
of the art of war&mdash;Grant and Sherman&mdash;were preparing
to strike the final blows at the tottering
Confederacy. Longstreet went to Virginia. Our
cavalry went to Georgia to our old commander,
General Joseph Wheeler. Our way was up the
French Broad river, through western North Carolina
and South Carolina, marching leisurely
where there were abundant supplies. We reached
Georgia as Sherman was preparing to move. On
the 9th day of May, just north of Dalton, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
were ordered to charge a force of the enemy, which
proved to be our old acquaintance, La Grange’s
brigade of Indiana cavalry. We went at them in
our usual style, at top speed, every fellow yelling
as loud as he could. They broke and retreated
precipitately. We took more than sixty prisoners,
including the brigade commander, Colonel La
Grange. His horse was wounded and fell, pinning
his rider to the earth just at a large farm
gate. John Haynie, quick as a flash, was at his
side, securing the prisoner, evidently an officer.
Addressing his captor, the prisoner said:</p>

<p>“You have a prize indeed. I am Colonel La
Grange. I did not know that you boys had got
down here from East Tennessee. I knew you as
soon as I saw you coming.”</p>

<p>With the help of some of the prisoners he was
released from his fallen horse, mounted on another,
and escorted by his captor to Colonel Harrison.
This incident came under my own observation.
For the interview which followed his
presentation to Harrison I am indebted to that
officer himself, who related it to me several years
after the war. La Grange said:</p>

<p>“I was in command of the brigade, and was
anxious for the commission of brigadier general.
Had some influential friends who were helping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
me. My division commander told me to go out,
run in the rebel pickets, skirmish a little and send
in a report, which he would forward with strong
recommendations for my promotion. I came out,
ran into the Texas Rangers, and am a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Only the fortune of war, my young friend,”
said Harrison. “Only the fortune of war.”</p>

<p>Our loss was quite heavy. Among the killed
were Charles T. Pelham of Company D, an educated
young man, of good family and fine promise,
a civil engineer by profession; D. F. Lily, a
young lawyer, who fell almost in sight of his
mother’s home, and W. H. Bigelow, a native of
Canada; both of these last were of Company G,
and both educated gentlemen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>SHERMAN’S WAGON TRAIN AND THE AFFAIRS WITH
M’COOK AND STONEMAN.</h3>


<p>The enemy, over one hundred thousand strong,
under one of the ablest commanders in the Federal
army, advanced on all the roads, overlapping
the Confederates, who took position after position,
to be turned by the superior numbers of
their adversaries.</p>

<p>At Resaca there was quite a spirited engagement
with a part of the advance. At Cassville
we took position and offered battle, but retired
before the flanking movement of the enemy. Near
this place Wheeler turned their left and captured
a train of wagons within a few miles of Sherman’s
army. The Rangers were not in this capture,
but when the enemy sent a force of cavalry to
retake his train, we met it in the most unique engagement
of the war. Sherman’s great army with
its hundreds of cannon, thousands of wagons and
other vehicles had passed along, pulverizing the
roads and fields into fine dust, which covered
everything, in many places several inches deep.
A single horseman riding along raised a cloud,
a company or regiment, such a dense fog as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
obscure everything. We were in line on one side
of a slight rise in the land. The cavalry of the
enemy above mentioned were approaching on the
other side of the hill. We were ordered forward,
and at the top of this hill we met each other,
enveloped in clouds of dust. We raised the usual
yell, although in doing so we took in large quantities
of Georgia real estate. We emptied our
pistols into the dust, and the enemy broke. We
did not pursue them very far; for we knew we
were near their main army, and feared we might
run into a brigade or two of infantry, as we
could not see anything twenty feet away. Previous
encounters had given us a contempt for
their cavalry and we did not hesitate to charge a
whole brigade if need be; but we had a wholesome
respect for large bodies of infantry. We
took a few prisoners, but did not know, owing to
the dust, what other casualties were inflicted on
them. We had seven wounded, including George
Burke of Company D, who was shot in the
shoulder.</p>

<p>Wheeler was determined to save his train, so
he tried to march all night, but a violent electrical
storm came up, rain fell in torrents, and our
progress was very slow, for the drivers of the
teams could not see the road, except by the glare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of the lightning. After this had gone on for several
hours, making scarcely so many miles, the
command camped in column&mdash;I believe without
orders.</p>

<p>Wheeler dearly loved their wagon trains. I believe
it is safe to say that from the first to the
last he captured as many wagons as he commanded
men. Thousands were burned, but other
thousands were secured for the use of our army.
The Northern contractors probably enjoyed this
as much as Wheeler; no doubt they would
have been glad to replace all the wagons, for a
reasonable consideration.</p>

<p>The retreat of the army continued to the very
gates of Atlanta. Here the Rangers made another
charge, in which Jesse Billingsly of Company D
was killed.</p>

<p>During the last week of July the enemy undertook
to play our game, and simultaneously made
two raids on our communications. One column
under General McCook, with 3500 cavalry, turned
our left. They crossed the Chattahoochie near
Campbelltown, passed through Fayetteville, where
they burned between fifty and one hundred
wagons, and struck the Macon railroad near
Jonesboro, twenty or twenty-five miles below Atlanta.
As soon as intelligence of this movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
reached Wheeler he started for the raiders. We
rode all night, coming up with them about daylight.
They made very feeble resistance and we
ran over them. It was now a chase of twenty
miles to the Chattahoochie again. As this stream
was not fordable, they made a stand to gain time
for crossing the river, which they were attempting
by means of boats. Our column was strung
out for several miles, Harrison’s brigade in front.
We were dismounted and pushed into the thick
woods. It was afternoon of the first day of
August, and about as hot as such days ever get.
The enemy made some resistance, but we drove
them steadily some four or five hundred yards,
when we heard firing in our rear where we had
left our horses. So we had to face about and
fight our way back. We got mixed up with Ross’
brigade, which had been dismounted as soon as
it came up. After some three hours of this work,
the enemy surrendered; that is, all who had not
crossed the river.</p>

<p>Wheeler reported 950 prisoners, 1200 horses and
two pieces of artillery as the fruits of this engagement.
There were many of their killed and
wounded lying in the bushes. I have no information
as to the number. Our regiment lost two
killed and ten wounded, including one from Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>pany
D. This was V. Catron, who was shot in
the leg.</p>

<p>The other column of the enemy, led by General
Stoneman, turned our right flank and struck
our communications lower down, near Macon.
His force was reported to be 3000. General Iverson
of the Confederate cavalry attacked them and
took 600 prisoners, including Stoneman himself,
with two pieces of artillery. The remainder of
their force in small detachments made their way
back as best they could. Iverson did not have
force enough to pursue them.</p>

<p>General Shoupe of General Hood’s staff recorded
in his diary, that the “First of August
deserved to be marked with a white stone.” These
operations cost the enemy nearly half of the two
raiding parties, and fully justified General Hood
in saying that our cavalry were equal to twice
their number of the enemy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>WHEELER’S SECOND RAID INTO TENNESSEE.</h3>


<p>Wheeler was now ordered to operate on the long
line of the enemy’s communications. Finding the
posts and bridges south of Chattanooga too
strongly fortified to offer any promise of successful
attack, Wheeler determined to go over into
middle Tennessee again. He went up along the
Holston above Knoxville, and then had to cross
under a severe fire of the enemy’s pickets. For
this undertaking there was a call for volunteers.
It looked as if the whole of the Rangers were volunteering,
and Wheeler had to stop them. The
fording was deep, but the enemy were easily
driven from their position. A small force, not
of the Rangers, was sent down toward Knoxville.
They met the enemy and were roughly handled;
about half of them were taken prisoners, and the
exultant enemy came on at a furious rate. Our
regiment was formed in an open field. Colonel
Harrison took position in front. We went forward
in a walk at first, and then in a trot. The
men were impatient. Officers kept saying:</p>

<p>“Steady, men! Keep back there!”</p>

<p>Then we heard the popping of pistols, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
eyes were turned on Harrison. The routed Confederates
came into view. Next the enemy in
close pursuit. The men could now hardly be restrained.
Finally Harrison shouted:</p>

<p>“Well, go then! &mdash;&mdash; you, go!”</p>

<p>The tap of the drum on the race track never
sent jockeys and racers to the front more impetuously
than the Rangers went at the sound of
these words. The enemy’s force was small, and
they faced about at once. Their horses were
nearly exhausted, and we soon overtook them, capturing
nearly the whole party, which did not
exceed two companies.</p>

<p>Our march was now across the Cumberland
mountains, by McMinnville, the familiar route
we had traveled two years before under Forrest,
and one year before under Wheeler. Just before
reaching Murfreesboro we turned to the left and
began to destroy the railroad leading to Chattanooga,
over which Sherman’s supplies had to be
carried. We piled fence rails on the track and
set them on fire. The heat caused the rails to
expand and bend into all shapes, rendering them
useless until straightened out; of course the ties
were burned also. In this way we destroyed some
fifty miles of the road; but the enemy had unlimited
resources, and kept trains loaded with rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>road
material at Nashville and Louisville; these
were rushed to the scene of our operations. With
large forces working day and night they soon got
the tracks in order.</p>

<p>We now moved forward to the Mussel Shoals,
where we were to cross the Tennessee river. In
a little skirmish on the north side W. H. Caldwell
of Company D was wounded in the hip. He was
disabled for the remainder of the war by this
hurt; never entirely recovered, in fact, walking
with a limp for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>After crossing the river the men of the Third
Arkansas, who had shown courage and devotion
on many fields, became greatly demoralized. Finding
themselves nearer home than they had been
for years, many of them deserted. One morning
it was reported that twelve of these men had gone.
A detail of twenty Rangers under Lieutenant
Joiner, the whole under Captain Bass of the
Third Arkansas, was sent after the deserters. I
was one of this detail. Riding forty or fifty miles a
day, we overtook four of them about twenty miles
from the great Mississippi and made them prisoners.
On the return my horse was badly injured
by falling through a broken plank in an old
bridge, and I was left afoot. Joiner gave me
orders to remain until my horse recovered, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
until I could procure another, and then join some
other command until I could get company over
Sand mountain, as that region was infested with
bushwhackers and murderers. It was some weeks
before I could get a mount, for horses were very
scarce, but this is not a narrative of my operations.</p>

<h3>“THE ROME RACES.”</h3>


<p>I am indebted to Comrade A. B. Briscoe for a
description of this incident.</p>

<p>“General Harrison, our old colonel, was in command
of the forces composed of ours and Ashby’s
brigade of mounted infantry and a battery of four
guns. For some reason, but contrary to all former
usages, our regiment was dismounted and
placed near the battery, and Ashby’s infantry kept
mounted to protect the flanks and led horses.
The fight had barely commenced when it was
realized from the immense bodies of infantry in
our front that it was a bad one. The battery was
ordered to the rear, but just as they were limbered
the Yankee cavalry poured in on our flanks
and completely enveloped us. I did not give an
order to run nor did I hear an order of any kind,
but I soon found myself dodging through and
among the Yankee cavalry, who were shouting to
us to surrender. We reached our horses, which
were not over 150 yards in the rear, mounted, and
after a very hasty formation charged out through
the enemy, and although we made repeated rallies
they ran us back about five miles. Why the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Yankees did not capture more of our men is a
mystery, as outside of the battery we lost very
few prisoners. To give an appropriate name to
this battle we called it “Rome Races,” for such
it was.”</p>

<p>In this race the colors furled around the staff
and in the oilcloth were lost&mdash;not captured&mdash;as
the subjoined letter shows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center">
“<span class="smcap">Dallas, Texas</span>, May 18, 1898.
</p>

<p>
“Terry’s Texas Rangers Association, Austin, Texas.
</p>

<p>“Gentlemen: I have been in Texas since 1890,
and have frequently endeavored to find some members
of Terry’s Texas Rangers, and finally, by accident,
met with your comrade, H. W. Graber,
and reported to him the finding of your flag the
day after our engagement with your forces near
Rome, Georgia. It happened in this way: I was
directed by the general commanding to take two
companies and move through the woods on the
right of our line to a certain point where a country
road intersected the main river road then occupied
by our brigade. Just before coming into
the main road I picked up a package or roll of
something, threw it over my saddle, and on my
return to the main command examined the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and found it to be the Terry’s Rangers’ flag in
its case. It seemed to have slipped off the staff
and been lost in that way. At the suggestion of
your comrade&mdash;Graber&mdash;I have made a request on
the authorities of the State of Indiana, who have
had charge of it ever since, soon after its capture,
and herewith enclose you a letter from Chas. E.
Wilson, military secretary at Indianapolis, which
seems to indicate there is no authority with the
executive department of the State to return the
flag, as it is in absolute control of the State Legislature,
which is a matter of exceeding regret to
me, as I should like to have returned the flag to
you in time for your next reunion at Austin. I
am furthermore able to assure you that this flag
was never displayed in the streets of Nashville,
as has been reported, but remained in possession
of our regiment until soon after it was found. We
returned direct to Louisville, from which point
it was sent by express direct to the State of Indiana.</p>

<p>“In view of the existing unsettled condition of
the country, I would suggest we let the matter
rest until our country is again pacified and returned
to its normal condition, when I will take
pleasure in making a further effort to return this
flag, which was not captured, but found, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
consider, therefore, property should be returned
to its owner.</p>

<p>This flag was returned to the survivors at
Dallas in October, 1898. Its loss was very mortifying
to the Rangers, as it had been presented
shortly before by the ladies of middle Tennessee.</p>

<p>In justice to the knightly “Count” Jones, I
must say that no one could have taken the colors
from him without taking his life.</p>

<p>In this action fell Wm. Nicholson of Company
D and Lieutenant Batchelor of Company C, and
perhaps others, but I have no record of them.</p>

<h3>THE LAST CAMPAIGN.</h3>


<p>Wheeler’s cavalry was now almost the only obstacle
to Sherman’s great march to the sea. They
harassed his columns front, flanks and rear, picking
up many prisoners; but three or four thousand
cavalry could make little resistance to the
onward sweep of 60,000 veterans under one of the
greatest captains of modern times. Conflicts
were of almost daily occurrence. The Rangers
were engaged at Buckhead Church and Waynesboro,
Georgia. Again at Aiken, South Carolina.
At Averysboro and Fayetteville, North Carolina,
where, after a night’s march, they surprised Kilpatrick’s
cavalry camp, but failed to bag that
redoubtable leader. In all of these conflicts the
losses were heavy. Old Company D lost in killed,
John Gage, P. R. Kennedy, Dave Nunn, Sam
Screws and Jim Wynne. Their list of wounded,
too, was large. P. R. Kyle and Geo. T. McGehee,
good ones both, were badly hurt at Aiken; McArthur,
Brannum and P. J. Watkins also. The
other companies sustained heavy losses. Lieutenant
Heiskell of Company K was killed. I wish
I could name them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
In all of these actions, the remnant of nearly
1200 <a id="enlistments"></a>enlistments charged with that dauntless courage
which had characterized them at Woodsonville,
at Bardstown, at Dalton and many other
brilliant fields of arms. Their old colonel, now
a brigadier general, Thomas Harrison; their
colonel, the knightly Cook, and the staid and ever
reliable Major Jarmon, were all stretched on beds,
racked with the pains of severe wounds. The
command now devolved on Captain Matthews,
who but a little over a year before had been
elected lieutenant, promoted to the rank of captain
by the bullets of the enemy which brought
down his superiors, was now, at Bentonville, to lead
the old regiment in the last charge, which will
always rank as one of the most brilliant feats of
arms in the history of wars. As I was not present
I will let Lieutenant Briscoe tell of it, for
he tells it well.</p>


<h3>THE LAST CHARGE.</h3>

<p>“We did but little fighting the first day, as the
enemy changed positions very rapidly. But the
second we were engaged in some severe skirmishes
all the forenoon, in one of which Major Jarmon,
our only remaining field officer, was severely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
wounded, when we were withdrawn a few hundred
yards to rest and give place for the infantry.</p>

<p>“We had been in this position resting and eating
our rations probably over an hour, when we
heard the boom of artillery directly in our rear.
Every man pricked up his ears, for we knew that
it meant something serious. Captain Doc Matthews
of Company K (my company) was in command
of the regiment, which numbered about 100
men. We were standing talking of the probable
cause of the artillery fire in our rear when General
Wheeler galloped up and asked for the commander
of the Rangers. He seemed a little excited.
His order was, ‘Captain, mount your men,
go as fast as you can and charge whatever you
find at the bridge.’ These were almost his exact
words. In less time than it takes to tell it, we
were mounted and racing to the rear. Within
about half a mile of the bridge we passed a small
brigade of infantry ‘double quicking’ in the same
direction. We saluted each other with a cheer
as we passed, for all felt that it was a critical
time in the battle. As we came upon some rising
ground we had a good view of the enemy across
an open field about 500 yards distant. Here we
halted an instant to close up the column, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Captain Matthews to salute General Hardee and
staff, who wished to know what troops we were.</p>

<p>“Captain Matthews told him and of our orders
from General Wheeler. He took a look across the
field at the dense blue line and said, ‘Then execute
your orders.’ It looked like the old regiment was
this time surely going to its grave. Everything
was so plain and clear you could see the men
handling their guns and hear their shouts of
command. Without a moment’s hesitation Captain
Matthews gave the order, ‘Charge right in
front,’ and with that wonderful rebel yell we
charged across the 500 yards of open field upon
and among the mass of Yankees. We rode them
down and emptied our pistols at close range.
When the force of the charge was expended we
fell back with about 200 prisoners.”</p>

<p>Like our other brilliant charges, it was the very
audacity that brought success.</p>

<p>In this charge fell, mortally wounded, Wm. J.
Hardee, Jr., son of Lieutenant General Hardee.
Nearly a year before he, with several other boys,
had run away from school to join the Rangers,
but on account of their extreme youth Colonel
Harrison sent them back to school. The boy
would not remain in school, so General Hardee
kept him with him for several <a id="months"></a>months, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
fretted to join the Rangers. Finally the father
consented. The boy was enlisted in Company D
and fell in this, his first action.</p>

<p>I reached the command shortly before the surrender.
The regiment in numbers was little more
than a good company. Battle and disease had
claimed and received their toll; but this little
remnant seemed as full of courage and spirit as
when first they left their State.</p>

<p>The dream was over. General Lee, “yielding
to overwhelming numbers and resources,” had
laid down his arms. General Johnston, again in
command of the Army of Tennessee, agreed
with Sherman to disband his army. Sadly the
Rangers dispersed, taking the roads to their distant
homes.</p>

<p>General Wheeler issued the following order,
which for intense feeling and felicity of expression
is a gem:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig"> “Headquarters Cavalry Corps, </p>
<p class="sig" style="margin-left: 35%"> “April 28, 1865. </p>

<p>“Gallant Comrades: You have fought your

struggle for liberty you have exhibited courage,
fortitude and devotion. You are the victors of
more than 200 sternly contested fields. You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
participated in more than a thousand conflicts of
arms. You are heroes! Veterans! Patriots!
The bones of your comrades mark battlefields

South Carolina, Georgia, <a id="Alabama"></a>Alabama and Mississippi.
You have done all that human exertion
could accomplish. In bidding you adieu, I desire
to tender my thanks for your gallantry in
battle, your fortitude under suffering and your
devotion at all times to the holy cause you have
done so much to maintain. I desire also to express
my gratitude for the kind feelings you have
seen fit to extend toward myself, and to invoke
upon you the blessing of our Heavenly Father, to
whom we must always look in the hour of distress.
Brethren, in the cause of freedom, comrades
in arms, I bid you farewell.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p>I am well aware of the imperfections of this
work. I can only say that I have tried to tell an
unvarnished tale, to do no one injustice, nothing
extenuate nor set down aught in malice. Beyond
a few old letters which have escaped the ravages
of mice, and such official reports as I could find,
I have been compelled to rely on memory&mdash;frail
and unreliable at best, more so after the lapse of
half a century. I beg to remind those who may
find fault that it is much easier to find fault than
to do good work. No two persons see events
exactly alike. This is illustrated in our courts
every day.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the martinet our organization
could hardly be called a regiment. A
distinguished lieutenant general is reported as
saying that it was not a regiment at all but “a
d&mdash;d armed mob.” If there was ever any serious
attempt to discipline it the effort was soon abandoned.
Volunteers we began, volunteers we remained
to the end. If any wished to evade duty,
they found a way, and the punishment for evasion
was light. To our credit it may be said that few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
ever avoided a fight. There were few real cowards
among us, and they were simply objects of pity.
If a man did not wish to go into a fight he held
his horse until it was over.</p>

<p>One reason of our almost uniform success was
the superiority of our arms. It will be remembered
that at the beginning the possession of a
good pistol was a requisite for enlistment. If a
man died or was killed his comrades kept his
pistol. When a prisoner of the enemy’s cavalry
was taken this part of his outfit was added to
the general stock, so that after a few months most,
if not all, had two weapons of this kind, and some
even tried to carry three or four. No other regiment
of the army was so supplied.</p>

<p>Again, it was a noteworthy fact that the men
were all good horsemen, accustomed to the use
and management of horses from childhood. When
three or four hundred of such men, charging as
fast as their horses would go, yelling like Comanches,
each delivering twelve shots with great
rapidity and reasonable accuracy, burst into the
ranks of an enemy, the enemy generally gave way.
It did not take us long to find this out; also the
enemy were not slow to “catch on.”</p>

<p>If it be said that other commands lost more
men in battle, the explanation is simple and easy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
The purpose of fighting is to destroy the enemy
in battle; all drill, organization and hard marches
are to this end&mdash;to kill and wound as many of
the enemy as possible. If this is granted, the
Rangers invite comparison with the best in any
army. It is safe to claim that the regiment
killed, wounded and captured a number of the
enemy at least several times our highest enlistment
of nearly 1200. If it be said that my claim
for superiority is biased by prejudice in favor of
my own regiment, I will give estimates of others.</p>

<p>In a letter to me acknowledging an invitation to
one of our reunions, General Wheeler said:</p>

<p>“They were unceasingly vigilant, matchlessly
brave and daring.”</p>

<p>General Thomas Jordan, an educated soldier,
a writer of ability, chief of staff to General Beauregard,
was selected by Forrest and his principal
officers to write a history of the campaigns of
that great soldier. In a note on page 160 of his
book, General Jordan says:</p>

<p>“This regiment was raised and commanded by
the lamented Colonel Terry, whose brief military
career, beginning as a volunteer scout at the first
Manassas, was full of distinction. He was killed
at Woodsonville, Kentucky. The privates included
a large number of the wealthiest and best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
educated young men of Texas, who, with many
others specially trained in the business of stock
raising on the vast prairies of that State, had acquired
a marvelous skill in horsemanship. The
career of this regiment has been one of the most
brilliant in the annals of war.”</p>

<p>Dr. John A. Weyeth, who also wrote a life of
Forrest, says, “No braver men ever lived than
the Texas Rangers.”</p>

<p>General Hood (“Advance and Retreat,” page
202) writes of the cavalry:</p>

<p>“I had, moreover, become convinced that our
cavalry were able to successfully compete with
double their numbers. The Confederacy possessed,
in my opinion, no body of cavalry superior
to that which I found guarding the flanks of the
Army of Tennessee when I assumed its direction.”</p>

<p>I now quote Federal authority. Writing of the
comparative merits of the soldiers of the two
armies, in a paper on the Kentucky campaign,
General Buell, while denying the superiority of
the Southern soldiers over the Northern, admits
it was true of the cavalry. He says:</p>

<p>“Another sectional distinction produced a more
marked effect in the beginning of the war. The
habits of the Southern people facilitated the formation
of cavalry corps which were comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
efficient even without instruction; and accordingly
we see Stuart, John Morgan and Forrest riding
with impunity around the union armies, destroying
or harassing their communications. Late in
the war that agency was reversed. The South
was exhausted of horses, while the Northern cavalry
increased in numbers and efficiency, and acquired
the audacity which had characterized the
Southern.”</p>

<p>Read that again. It comes very near saying
that the South was overcome because the supply
of horses failed. The writer is an educated soldier
and student of war.</p>


<h3>L’ENVOI.</h3>

<p>My task is done. My story is told. I have
derived pleasure as well as pain and grief from
the recital; pleasure in going back over the dreary
waste of years to the morning of life, and dwelling
in memory amid the scenes of my early manhood;
pain that I can not do justice to all who,
at the call of country, periled their young lives for
home and the right; grief for the heroic dead,
who sleep in unmarked graves wherever duty lead
to danger and death. Their matchless courage
and devotion earned undying fame.</p>
